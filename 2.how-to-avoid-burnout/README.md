# How to avoid burnout.

There's a popular philosophy about achieving success that goes something like this:

> "Work hard consistently, even when you don't want to, and you will eventually accomplish your goals."

I like to call this the "brute force" approach to success, because it promotes consistently trudging through the challenges between you and your desired destination, without taking into consideration the broader context of the problem. Software engineers and mathematicians know all too well that a brute force algorithm, while technically correct, is almost always suboptimal. I wonder then: could there be better path to achieving success?

## The problem with brute force.

I can't argue with the fact that hard work, applied consistently toward your goals over time, is a tried and true way to reach them. The problem is, many people will take this to the extreme and suffer burnout far before their goals have been accomplished. Those that do achieve success this way often endure stretches of hardship and sacrifice as they grind their way to the finish line in the face of depleted motivation.

In either case, the journey or the destination has been severely compromised. That doesn't sound like any way to live.

## The culprit of your suffering.

If we look closely, we can see that a lack of motivation is to blame in both scenarios â€“ either for the burnout or for the unpleasant grind. This is a key realization, because it implies that maximizing your time spent in a motivated state will therefore minimize your risk of burnout.

To put it another way, doing hard work _when you really don't want to_ elicits the strongest feelings of burnout. Whereas if I'm constantly motivated toward my goals, my risk of burning out before achieving them is dramatically reduced, and the enjoyment I'll experience along the way is sure to be amplified.

So how do we maximize our time spent working toward goals that we feel motivated to achieve?

## We must ride the waves of motivation.

You knew this deep down already, I'm only reminding you: **Motivation comes in waves**. Nobody is 100% motivated to wake up and go to the gym every morning. Even if its your dearest passion, and you have all the reason in the world to stick to this habit, there will come periods of time where you simply feel less excited to. It's only natural.

Yet, there are two sides to this coin. If you will inevitably experience periods of reduced motivation toward a goal, then you will also experience periods of relatively increased motivation. Maybe your wedding is coming up, and you want to look your absolute best in front of all your friends and family. Maybe you had a health scare, and the importance of regular exercise has been made glaringly apparent. Or maybe you're just more interested in spending your time on a new hobby, and your motivation levels have shifted toward a different set of goals. 

Whatever the reason, know that **this fluctuation in motivation is completely normal**. It's unavoidable. So rather than applying a brute force approach to success that would have us suffer through the low points and risk burnout, what if we adopted a work ethic that flexibly adapted to these ups and downs?

By tapering back our efforts during periods of low motivation, and by ramping them up when it feels natural to, we can align our time spent with how our minds _naturally want to be spending it_. I call this "riding the waves of motivation," though it's assuredly not my original idea.
