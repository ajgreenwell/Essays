# How to avoid burnout and accomplish your goals.

There's a popular philosophy about achieving success that goes something like this:

> "Work hard consistently, even when you don't want to, and you will eventually accomplish your goals."

I like to call this the "brute force" approach to success, because it promotes consistently trudging through the challenges between you and your desired destination, without taking into consideration the broader context of the problem. Software engineers and mathematicians know all too well that a brute force algorithm, while technically correct, is almost always suboptimal. I wonder then: could there be better path to achieving success?

## The problem with brute force.

I can't argue with the fact that hard work, applied consistently toward your goals over time, is a tried and true way to reach them. The problem is, many people will take this to the extreme and suffer burnout far before their goals have been accomplished. Those that do achieve success this way often endure stretches of hardship and sacrifice as they grind their way to the finish line in the face of depleted motivation.

In either case, the journey or the destination has been severely compromised. That doesn't sound like any way to live.

## The culprit of your suffering.

If we look closely, we can see that a lack of motivation is to blame in both scenarios – either for the burnout or for the unpleasant grind. This is a key realization, because it implies that maximizing your time spent in a motivated state will therefore minimize your risk of burnout.

To put it another way, doing hard work _when you really don't want to_ elicits the strongest feelings of burnout. Whereas if I'm constantly motivated toward my goals, my risk of burning out before achieving them is dramatically reduced, and the enjoyment I'll experience along the way is sure to be amplified.

So how do we maximize our time spent working toward goals that we feel motivated to accomplish?

## We must ride the waves of motivation.

You knew this deep down already, I'm only reminding you: **motivation comes in waves**. Nobody is 100% motivated to wake up and go to the gym every morning. Even if its your dearest passion, and you have all the reason in the world to stick to this habit, there will come periods of time where you simply feel less excited to. It's only natural.

Yet, there are two sides to this coin. If you will inevitably experience periods of reduced motivation toward a goal, then you will also experience periods of relatively increased motivation. Maybe your wedding is coming up, and you want to look your absolute best in front of all your friends and family. Maybe you had a health scare, and the importance of regular exercise has been made glaringly apparent. Or maybe you're just more interested in spending your time on a new hobby, and your motivation levels have shifted toward a different set of goals. 

Whatever the reason, know that **this fluctuation in motivation is completely normal**. It's unavoidable. So rather than applying a brute force approach to success that would have us suffer through the low points and risk burning out, what if we adopted a work ethic that flexibly adapted to these ups and downs?

By tapering back our efforts during periods of low motivation, and by ramping them up when motivation runs high, we can align our time spent with how our minds _naturally want to be spending it_. I call this "riding the waves of motivation," though it's assuredly not my original idea.

## Pitfalls to watch out for.

Our minds love to play tricks on us, especially to avoid doing hard work. For many people, it can be all too easy to lean on this philosophy as an excuse to put off difficult tasks. I still catch myself headed into this pitfall every once in awhile. The key is to be brutally honest with yourself about why you are or are not working toward a particular goal. Are you lazily floating around in the water, or are you actually up on your surfboard riding the waves?

Most importantly, understand that tapering back your efforts in one area doesn't mean you should make zero progress toward that goal. Psychological momentum is real, and letting your progress slow to a complete halt is a surefire path to failure. If at all possible, continue to make _some_ progress, just at a reduced rate. The goal is for your efforts to be sustainable, so that even tiny amounts of progress can accumulate into grand achievements over time.

At the end of the day, it's up to you _and you alone_ to ride these waves effectively. It's unlikely that anyone else will call you out for letting progress toward a goal completely stall, so you must reflect on your priorities regularly and rebalance the way you allocate your time toward each objective.

Oh, and it's totally ok to fall off your board by the way, as long as you get back up and begin riding again.

## Two concrete examples.

In an effort to help you understand what it might look like to ride the waves of motivation in your life, I've included two examples from my own.

### The fitness example.

For the first nine months of my new fitness hobby, I exercised roughly six days each week. I'm still dedicated to improving my fitness levels further, but I've acknowledged that my interests are shifting toward other new hobbies as well, like writing these essays.

Rather than forcing myself to continue going to the gym six days each week and risking burnout, I've tapered back my routine to three days per week. So far, I'm noticing better recovery between workouts and higher levels of motivation to give it my all when I do go to the gym. Amazingly, the rate of progress toward my strength goals has been nearly unchanged, while I now have more time to spend pursuing other activities too.

### The work example.

Currently I work as a mid-level software engineer at Wayfair. I love my job and my team, but some months I'm more motivated to grow as an engineer than others. With ambitious promotion goals always on the horizon, I can't afford to risk burning out. So instead of forcing myself to grind through the difficult weeks, I give myself a break. Sometimes I'll take a nap in the middle of the day if I need it. Maybe I'll pick up some easier projects that I know won't be so demanding. On rare occasions when burnout has felt like it was just a couple weeks away, I've taken unplanned PTO to hit the reset button.

But don't mistake these occasional periods of reduced output for laziness – they represent intentional, tactful choices made to preserve the sustainability of my progress and growth. Just this past Friday, I stayed in alone to bump some smooth jazz and crank out an inspired idea I had for a new feature on our platform. A lot of people might look at that choice and label me a "geek" or a "workaholic" for writing code on a Friday night. I see at it as a calculated decision to hone my craft while motivation ran high. I was just riding the waves. 

# That's it.

I hope you now feel like you have the tools to achieve success while avoiding burnout and minimizing unnecessary suffering. If you ever experience external resistance to this approach, kindly remind your critic that the ultimate goal is sustainable progress. Or just send them a link to this essay.
