# 1. Why I decided to start writing essays, and why you should too.

Starting off a bit meta, I know. But this is a new endeavor for me, and as with anything, I always find it useful to begin by articulating my _why_. If I can pin that down, my motivation to stick with this habit is far more likely to persist. It may wax and wane over time, but with an understanding of how this new habit will positively impact my life, there's no telling how far it may take me.

What follows are a handful of reasons that inspired me to start writing essays on a regular basis. Let's begin!

## Valuable insights require intentional analysis.

The flow of information in the modern world is so ubiquitous, that many (including myself) are striving to reduce the number of inputs to their minds, not increase it. We can choose to be willing subjects, getting tossed about by the winds of information without control over where they take us. Or, we can choose to fashion a mainsail, strap it to our mast, and grab hold of the wheel. Like a sailor harnessing the power of the wind to traverse the open ocean, writing essays will capture these gusts of information and transform them into coherent insights that propel us forward. Plus, because our minds are so much better at storing information through story, we are far more likely to internalize these learnings and apply them to our lives along the way.

## Searchability expands your brain's capacity for knowledge.

Not too long ago, writers seeking to organize their thoughts would've been forced to do so with pen and paper, making it notably more difficult to find a particular passage months later. Now, with the ability to store these essays in a searchable format online, we can quickly navigate our documented thoughts with a simple keyword search.

This is powerful, because it means that I don't have to commit every important insight to memory, and I don't have to remember exactly where I wrote it. You don't have to remember where you read it either. We just need to type in a few related words.

## Producers create value for themselves and their community.

As far as content creation goes, writing online has the lowest barrier to entry. It’s incredibly easy to begin sharing your stories across any number of platforms. This is a double edged sword, because it means this medium also has a substantial amount of competition. But we’re not worried about monetizing our thoughts directly right now. If you’re _really_ good at writing, and you have many valuable insights to share, maybe this hobby could become profitable for you someday. 


But just by producing something tangible, you will have started down the path toward a new way of living. In a world where the forces of consumerism are begging you to spend your precious time and attention for the benefit of large corporations, you will be taking a major step toward benefitting yourself and your community. You will be contributing something to the information economy, not just consuming its contents.

## Organized thought precedes all value creation.

Essays serve as a basic form of organized thought that can be transformed in a multitude of ways. Want to repurpose your essays as blog posts? The content is already there, you’re just a few HTML files away from starting your own website. Want to write a book, but not sure what its topic should be? Over time, patterns will emerge across your essays. Many of them may relate to specific themes, and from these themes you can extract a clear message that you want to publish. Heck, some people even publish collections of essays as books and call it a day there.


What’s more? Essays can form the basis for video content too, serving as scripts to be fleshed out further and visualized on-screen. They may help you come up with an idea for a new business, or they may cause you to connect with a new friend. The doors of value creation can open to you, if you just take the time to organize your thoughts.

## Writing is a _very_ high leverage skill.

Being able to articulate your thoughts clearly, whether on paper or in person, is one of the most valuable skills any knowledge worker can have. As Joel Spolsky said in [one of his essays](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/)  on software development,

> “Even on the small scale, when you look at any programming organization, the programmers with the most power and influence are the ones who can write and speak in English clearly, convincingly, and comfortably.”

I believe this holds true no matter what kind of knowledge work you pursue. Without an effective means for achieving buy-in, it becomes impossible to collaborate with others and solve impactful problems together. One person can only do so much on their own, and communication is the lever by which we can move worlds to overcome the toughest challenges.

The software engineer in me likes to think of my communication skills as the interface between my thoughts and the rest of the world. With such an important responsibility on its shoulders, why wouldn’t I refine that interface as well as I possibly can?

# That's it.

I hope these reasons have inspired you to begin writing in some way for your own benefit. At the very least, I hope you'll join me on this journey as I stumble about on deck, attempting to harness the howling winds of information and venture onward to my next destination.

No, I'm not a sailor (yet).
