# Quitting social media gave me mind back.

You have to decide for yourself whether social media has a positive or negative effect on your well-being. We all have varying priorities for our time and attention, so I can't possibly claim that it's bad for everyone. But is it good for _you_? Maybe it's time to find out.

After the thousand-and-first morning of scrolling through YouTube upon waking up, I started to realize what little control I had over my usage of these platforms. Sometimes an hour would go by before the covers finally came off, and I'd start my day in a hazy fog of uninspired apathy – my mind already exhausted from processing the overwhelming stimulus it had been jolted awake with. 

I have no idea how many mornings of mine have actually begun this way, but _many_ would be a laughable understatement. I believe millions of people around the world are experiencing a similar phenomenon as they eagerly swipe to the next TikTok, Twitter meme, or Instagram photo on their handheld supercomputers.

In the past decade since these platforms began their takeover, we've gradually lost control over our attention. These companies have captured it for their own benefit, with the average person's social media usage increasing to [more than 2 hours and 27 minutes each day](https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/). Let's assume for the sake of discussion that you fall roughly in line with this average. That means you'll spend about 10% of each day on social media, or 15% of your waking hours. I wonder: what does this average represent as a percentage of your _free_ time?

Twenty years from now you will have spent about seven years working, seven more sleeping, and another two on social media. That only leaves four years for _all other activities_. Like [the fabled frog unknowingly boiling to death amidst a bath of gradually warming water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog), our society has remained seemingly unaware of these harmful changes to our environment. Even those of us who intuitively suspect that social media is a poor use of our time still struggle to change our behavior. What gives?

## Your brain chemistry has been exploited for profit.

Evolution has hardwired our brains to crave novelty. Primitive humans benefitted greatly from this tendency, as it motivated them to explore, learn and adapt to new environments, thus increasing our chances of survival as a species. 

Unfortunately for us, the rapid advancement of technology has far surpassed the natural progression of evolution by many magnitudes. Our brains can't keep up. Digital experiences can now stimulate the same cravings for novelty that only real experiences once could. With every burst of digital novelty [comes a hit of real dopamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627306004752), motivating us to continue exploring these online platforms. In the process, we consume days worth of digital content and many hours of branded advertising. This is how social media companies make money.

In a stroke of evil genius, these tech giants introduced a wrinkle to the formula that would change our consumption habits forever. By leveraging artificial intelligence to power their recommendation algorithms, these platforms have rapidly honed their ability to capture our attention for _as long as they possibly can_. Even worse, these same algorithms further align every content creator's incentives with this mission. For a video producer to make money on YouTube and grow their audience, they often need to make content that panders to the metrics these algorithms champion, including user engagement and watch time. The more these creators can keep us glued to our screens, the more money they'll make too.

Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not all doom and gloom. In different ways, these platforms have brought tremendous value to people's lives. They've created jobs for thousands of tech workers and thousands more content creators, provided access to otherwise inaccessible connections, and spread information across a populace faster than we ever dreamed possible. These are just a few of the convincing arguments in their favor.

I'm not advocating for the downfall of social media platforms altogether; I'm just awfully wary of the insidious drawbacks that come with their unchecked usage. We must each weigh the pros and cons of how they affect our lives, in order to discern their net impact and inform the ways in which we choose to use them.

## A simple experiment you can try.

Over the past month, I've been steadily removing  social media apps from my phone in a quest to discover the marginal value they add to my daily life.

Starting with Instagram, and progressing week by week to the removal of Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube, I sought to prove their individual worth by process of elimination. I now have zero social media apps on my phone. That's not to say that I don't still have accounts for each platform – if needed, I can always sign in through a web browser and catch up on any important things I've missed. Or so I told myself when I started.

Instead of discovering how much value these platforms added to my life, I've now come to realize how distinctly _unimportant_ the vast majority of my content consumption has been. I don't find myself feeling left out, and I don't miss the bombardment of useless information taking up my time and mental space. At most, I may sign into these websites once every few weeks now. That's a whole lot better than spending 2 hours and 27 minutes each day.

It's not that all the content I consumed on these platforms was meaningless – for years I've touted YouTube as one of the best resources for learning new skills. And I stand by that statement. But having immediate access to these apps on my phone had become a liability. I couldn't trust myself to discern between time spent productively learning and time spent aimlessly scrolling. The recommendation algorithms had won, and I had formed unconscious habits of giving them my attention for far too long.

## Bidding farewell to the background hum of nervous mental energy.

Aside from getting all that valuable time back, I've noticed one other enormous benefit of my reduced social media usage.

For years now I've experienced a hum of nervous mental energy lingering in the background of my mind throughout most of the day. I once attributed this hum to some kind of chronic anxiety. Maybe that's the technical term for it. Having experienced real anxiety attacks before, this hum felt similar, just less intense and more persistent. But it nagged at me, and it negatively impacted my frame of mind.

To better understand this feeling, I spent much of the past year deeply exploring the practice of mindfulness meditation. Short of shipping myself off to the himalayas to study as a Tibetan monk, I've tried just about everything I could to face this feeling head on, understand its cause, and find relief from it. My efforts were only partially successful.

I've leaned on exercise as a coping mechanism to help cover up the hum with extra endorphins and other pleasant neurotransmitters. That can work for a time. But I could never quite get that hum to go away for good. It was still there, always lingering in the background of every shared experience and every moment alone with my thoughts.

That is, until I removed these social media apps from my phone. The first time I ever heard someone else put a finger on this feeling was while reading one of Cal Newport's bestsellers, _Deep Work_:

> "...the lack of [digital] distraction in my life tones down that background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people's lives."

Reading these words catalyzed my "Aha" moment and inspired me to dramatically reduce my social media usage for good. It has been one of the single most positively impactful changes to my lifestyle that I can remember. But just in case you won't take my word for it, and you won't take Cal's either, you may find [this recent study on the benefits of giving up social media for one week](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2021.0324) to be particularly convincing.

# That's it.

Maybe you won't be deleting Facebook from your phone today, and that's perfectly ok. As long as you begin to take a closer look at your usage of these platforms and the effect they have on your life, you'll be on the right path no matter where it leads you.
