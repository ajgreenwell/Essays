# How Hair Loss Can Lead You Toward Enlightenment.

My hands are cramping, it's 11:55 PM, and all I want to do is tuck into a cold set of soft sheets. But unfortunately, I'm only halfway through my 45 minute nightly scalp massage routine. "This is a worthwhile sacrifice," I assure myself, praying that with a few more months of disciplined effort, I might finally begin to reclaim the hairline of a typical 24 year old.

Later that night I’d go on to finish waging my daily war against androgenic alopecia by showering with some wildly overpriced hair products and carefully applying droppers full of specially formulated, prescription-strength topical medications to my scalp. The next morning, I’d start again with more massages. I was determined, but exhausted. If this is what it took to maintain my hairline, my attractiveness, my self-esteem, and the hope of finding love, I could soldier on.

Or so I thought.

Fast-forward 1 month, and I’m letting out blood curdling screams while an IV pumps fentanyl into my right forearm inside an infirmary tent at the base of Mount Sunapee. One of my best friends is watching in horror, and another is gripping my hand tightly, while three medics attempt to rip a ski boot off my shattered left leg. A couple sleepless nights in the hospital and one birthday surgery later, I’m finally back home being tucked into those familiar cold sheets by my dad. I haven’t showered in 3 days, and I won’t for another 4, so it’s pretty safe to say that scalp massages are not top-of-mind.

Dazed amidst the fog of narcotics for two weeks, I reason that a hair loss prevention routine isn’t what my body needs right now. Compared to healing a broken bone, the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze. Eventually a month has gone by without even touching those prescription topicals, and I notice I feel remarkably lighter. Not just because I’ve lost 10 pounds of muscle laying on the couch all day; I actually feel mentally lighter. What once seemed like a daunting reality – the unwanted growth of my forehead – now seemed inconsequential compared to the grand scheme of sh*t that can go wrong in your life.

Over the following months, I’d watch as my hairline began to recede at a breakneck pace. This I had come to expect – the hair loss meds only work as long as you continually use them. Stop, and you’ll quickly lose any follicles they had been protecting. For most people, this might invoke anxiety. But for the first time, I actually felt acceptance. “This is happening, whether I fight it or not,” I thought, realizing that the fight itself was more arduous than the prospect of losing.

## Escaping Samsara – The Circle of Suffering

- Talk about clinging / attachment, and how those formed the root of my suffering with hair loss. Once I let go, the suffering ended
- Suffering is your greatest teacher. Use it as a sign to look deeper for truth and meaning. 
- The greater its intensity, the more fervently you will search for its end, like a cat chasing its tail.
- Why are we so attached to superficial things like our hair anyway?
- At least for me, I was afraid that losing my hair would result in loss of love in my life. Love is at the center of fulfillment, meaning, and purpose for existence.
- If we assume that you nor I will ever attain any permanent state of enlightenment (stands to reason, giving that everything is fleeting), then we can presume to spend some significant portion of our lives attached to outcomes
- Learning to let go of attachment does not mean acceptance of any outcome. It does not promote a lack of effort to improve your life. Enlightened or not, it would still be more enjoyable to be present and mindful of pleasant experiences than painful ones.
